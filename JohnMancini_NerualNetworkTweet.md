Software Design section 1

	For my project proposal I am interested in building a multi layered neural network for approximating the moods of tweets. <br>I think I will use tensor flow for this project, a python deep learning API. In essence, we would train a neural network with labeled tweets (these are available online with enough labeled tweets to train a neural network to reach high approximation). The labeling of these tweets would be some mood indicator. Finally, once the neural network is trained, I want to store the data from the network online and either create some sort of front-end where a user can input a tweet, or some backend where, using the twitter API, a user can run all of their thread tweets through the neural network and analyze the data.
	
	
	This project would reach quite a few milestones insofar as the education goals of this class go. It would be done with object oriented design, accessing a database, potentially a GUI with a mark up language, code optimization would likely play a role, UML would be a necessity for designing the neural network, and potentially parallelism would be employed to speed up the matrix multiplications that take place during the neural network. 
	
	
	My contribution to this project would be building it in its entirety. I think it would be possible to do it from scratch in a month with a motivated team. Although it would be a huge learning curve, we would learn a tremendous amount from doing this project.
